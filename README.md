# ðŸª‘ A Chair for Life
Welcome to **A Chair for Life**, a simple single-page web app all about chairs! ðŸŽ‰  
<br>
This project is a re-make of a previous React version, now built with Angular.

## âœ¨ About the Project
This app was created as a way to practice Angular and TypeScript, while keeping the focus on clean component-based UI design and simple state management.  

The goal is to showcase chairs in a fun, minimal, and structured way while experimenting with Angular features and custom libraries.

If youâ€™re curious about the supporting library, you can find it published under the name **@beexy** (A personal component library under developing. News Soon).
